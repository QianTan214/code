django-admin

django web application

dynamically generated html and css


python manage.py runserver

python manage.py startapp hello


views: view user wants to see


django-admin startproject airline

python manage.py startapp flights(application)

go to setting.py, add "flights" into INSTALLED_APPS

go to urls.py, import include, path("flights/", include("flights.urls"))

go to flights folder, create a new file called urls.py

在models.py里，写python class


python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py shell

use python commands, no need to use sql:
from flights.models import Flight

f = Flight(origin = "New York", destination = "London", duration =  415)
f.save()

Flight.objects.all() # 像是select all

flight = flights.first()

flight.id
flight.origin
flight.destination
...

flight.delete()

def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.id}: {self.origin} to {self.destination}"

python preferred:
is not None
